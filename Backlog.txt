Left to do:

1. Finish the 'Continues update -- Ip Manager -- Branch Updater' chain:

    Todo: Gather Those two into one Object.
    BRC = Batch-request-counter, shared atomic counter.
    ARC = Allow-request-counter, shared atomic counter.

    Qu = A queue to hold every sender of 'updater-depleted' message.

    DRC = Depleted-request-counter, atomic counter (Not shared - Specific to Ip Manager).
    MRC = Max-request-counter, atomic counter (Not shared - Specific to Ip Manager),
          Initiated to 0 at the construction of Ip Manager.

    Max-requests = Maximal amount of request before closure, Currently ~300.
    Reset() = wait 60 seconds, then i <== Qu.length, then reset BRC and ARC DRC,
              dequeue first i q from Qu: send 'Continue' to each q.
    
    1.1 Ip Manager has to notice the 'updater-depleted' message, then
    
        1.1.1 No more request can be made ==> MRC++ == Max-requests:
              Close all Branch-Updaters, then,
              Notify Continues Update 'Depleted', then
              Close Ip Manager.

        1.1.2 Can make more request ==> MRC++ < Max-requests:

            1.1.2.1 'updater-depleted' message is valid (Truthful) ==> BRC == top limit:

                1.1.2.1.1 This is the first 'updater-depleted' message in this batch ==>
                          DRC++ == 0 : Enqueue sender to Qu, then do Reset().

                1.1.2.1.2 This is NOT the first 'updater-depleted' message in this batch ==>
                          DRC++ != 0: Enqueue sender to Qu.
            
            1.1.2.2 'updater-depleted' message is invalid (False) ==> BRC != top limit:
                    Return 'Continue' to sender.

    1.2 'Branch Updater' stops on 'Depleted' response from Updater.
        1.2.1 'Branch Updater' notifies 'Ip Manager'.
    
    1.3 Upon 'Continue' response from 'Ip Manager', 'Branch Updater' has to continue Updater's action.
        1.3.1 Updater has to continue from its stopping point.

Ip Manager Counter Should:
    1 : Count and Reset Counter of 'depleted' messages, to catch the first message.
    2 : Count Remaining-Untouched Request-batches.

Branch-Updater's Should:
    3: Count Consumed Requests, of the request Batch.
